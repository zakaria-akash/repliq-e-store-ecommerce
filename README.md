This project is a practical challenge given by REPLIQ to evaluate my front-end development skills as part of the recruitment process for the position of Junior UXUI Developer (Frontend). This project is about to implement some specific e-commerce admin portal views in the React/Next.js ecosystem. Some front-end UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5, Ant-Design, Ant-Design-Icon and Font-Awesome-Icon are also used to make the layouts more attractive and responsive.
